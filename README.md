# 2DBipedWith2LinkArms-SwingingMode
Trajectory Generator based on Parametric Optimization Technique

This program can be used to characterize the acceleration characteristics registered by a handheld device(for example smartphone) carried by a 2D bipedal robot with 2 link arms. The cyclic walking gait is generated using parametric optimization technique. The gait is composed of two single support phases ending with impacts.
